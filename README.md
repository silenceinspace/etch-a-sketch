# etch-a-sketch
Start of the project - the 23rd of September
Finish of the project - the 25th of October

Slowly but surely I've already finished my second js project. It's been challenging to the extent that I eventually decided to refuse from a couple of interesting and useful ideas/features I wanted to implement as well. It seemed to me that I tried to make something that was simply over my head. Before being able to figure out those complex approaches I dreamed about on my own, I do need to get a better foundation of my knowledge.

There's not much rewarding feeling while copying pasting somebody else's code. Code is all about understanding, understanding what each line is supposed to do. I definitely feel some improvement and would like to keep dedicating my time to javascript so that I will be good enough at it someday.

As I told myself the other day - I should regularly make at least 1 hour for javascript and the odin project. I know sometimes it feels too little (mostly when I'm on the ball and move throughout the project fast), but other times it can be too complicated to make even the slightest change. So I end up getting stuck at the same place for a couple of days. But remember this - to solve a problem or find a good solution, you have to understand what the problem is and what potential steps you should take. Keep it up!:D
